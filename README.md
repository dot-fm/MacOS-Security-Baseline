# Baseline Considerations and commonly accepted best practices for usage with Apple Mac's running macOS 10.14.x

# Baseline Security for Modern Apple Macs running macOS Mojave 10.14.x (darwin kernel 18.0)
This Program is intended AS IS.
baseline init for secure macOS systems (as of 10.14.x)
This program is merely an outline whose guidelines concern hardening, at an extremely simplistic & high-level darwin/macOS system (as ox kernel 18/Mojave base 14.x)
Therefore, it shall NOT, serve nor does it attempt to be, a complete substitute nor extremely secure tweaked system to be used in favor of macOS.
This program and its contents are merely intended as a 'baseline' secure generalized overview of systems tweaks centered around "power-users"(people who are the least bit concerned with their systems and what they type into it.)
To reiterate: DO NOT, type these command blindly without prior knowledge and full understanding of their outcome.
In no way, shape, form or factor am i responsible for whatever happens to anyone whom decides to proceed with the following commands.

# the overall project has been compiled from both experience and an incredible amount of numerous sources.
most notably it could not have been possible without the previous work done by 
dr.druh (macOS security basics) (pioneer of the initial 'macOS security "for the paranoids, explained for dummies by one seriously curious yet astute freaking freaking hacker/bsdnix guru'")
alichtman/stronghold (one of the first simple, concise and trustworthy "mac-sec"-centred automation frameworks for gh enthusiasts.)
mathiasbynens's notoriously and outstanding compendium of his own dotfiles (neverending working in progress) and a true mac/unix composition of useful dotfiles.
